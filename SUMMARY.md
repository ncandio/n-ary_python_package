```

## Key Components

1. **narytreemodule_unified.cpp**: This is the main C++ file that implements the Python bindings using the Python C API directly. It defines:
   - Python object structures for the tree and node views
   - Methods for tree operations (size, empty, clear, set_root, root, etc.)
   - Methods for node operations (add_child, data, set_data, child_count, is_leaf)
   - Module initialization and type definitions

2. **succinct_narytree_unified.cpp**: This file contains the core C++ implementation of the SuccinctNaryTree class, which features:
   - Memory-efficient storage using vectors
   - Locality optimization
   - Lazy balancing mechanism
   - Statistics collection for performance monitoring

3. **setup.py**: Configuration for building the Python package, specifying:
   - Extension module definition
   - Source files
   - Compiler flags for C++17 support
   - Package metadata

4. **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation with:
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Feature descriptions

## Package Features

The narytree package provides:

- `narytree.SuccinctNaryTree`: Main tree class with locality optimization
- `narytree.NodeView`: Node view for tree operations
- Utility functions like `create_tree()` and `benchmark_locality()`
- Memory-efficient storage using succinct data structures
- Lazy balancing to maintain performance during modifications
- Performance statistics collection

## Usage

To build and install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

To use in Python:

```python
import narytree

# Create a tree
tree = narytree.SuccinctNaryTree("root")
root = tree.root()

# Add children
child = root.add_child("child")

# Check size
print(f"Tree size: {tree.size()}")
```

This package represents a high-performance implementation with significant memory reduction compared to traditional tree implementations.
